# ConcertTowerDefense

You've just booked the biggest Rock n Roll festival your band has ever played at, this is what you always dreamed of... Until it turns out the venue was built on a graveyard full of angry disco spirits who hate what the youngin's are listening to these days!

Build your band, protect the stage, and create rocking tunes while doing it! In Concert Tower Defense, you need to protect the stage from a wave of disco ghosts intent on tearing it down. Place instruments to repel the ghosts, and build up a tune as you add them. Each instrument has three unique tracks which unlock as you place more of them.

This game is an experiment and there are so many things I would like to tune but just don't have time for. There is only a single wave and it's not the most challenging but I hope the experience of building up your band and creating a song is fun. Maybe I will be able to come back to this project one day.

## Development

This game was built with Unity 2020.1.11f1 on Windows. I have only tested it on WebGL.
